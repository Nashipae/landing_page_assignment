  <h2>Who is Nash</h2>
  <p>An experienced website developer who is keen to detail and passionate about results. I am also skilled in project management, digital communication strategy and I am an experienced agile coach.</p>
    Since I am all-rounded, my alter-ego is beading and knitting. One of my philanthropic deeds include teaching programming to Primary School children, creating programs for charity institutions and sharing the beading and knitting skill with women-self-help groups in the remote areas.
