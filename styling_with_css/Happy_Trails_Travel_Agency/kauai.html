  <h2>Kauaʻi, Hawaai</h2> 

  <p>Called the Garden Isle, Kauaʻi is a tropical Eden, with lush rainforests, waterfalls, and spectacular green coastal peaks. A natural masterpiece of dramatic lava-sculpted landscapes, the island has a more laid-back vibe than its popular sister islands of Maui and Oahu. Though Kauai is known for being home to one of the rainiest places on earth, the island is comprised of several microclimates, and the area around touristy Poipu tends to be drier. Underwater, you'll find colorful coral reefs, where turtles and tropical fish swim. On land, you can bask on golden beaches, admire the cloud-capped scenery from the cliffs above Hanalei Bay, hike among the velvety peaks of the breathtaking Nāpali Coast, and explore the deep and jungly 10-mile-long Waimea Canyon. Tropical gardens, waterfalls, cute coastal towns, and fantastic surf breaks are other top tourist attractions. Don't be surprised if you find yourself sharing the beach with slumbering monk seals; nature reigns here, and that's a big part of the island's allure. </p>
